Getting It
----------

Windows automated snapshot builds are created every time the main repository is pushed to.
They can be downloaded here: <http://hci.iastate.edu/~rpavlik/downloads/vrjugglua/jenkins/>
###Source code
    git clone git://github.com/vancegroup/vr-jugglua.git

GitHub provides a lot of useful services for us at [project homepage][home].

Dependencies:
-------------

- CMake 2.6 or newer (tested mainly with 2.8.3) - build system generator

- Boost 1.35 or newer (tested mainly with 1.40 and 1.45)

- VR Juggler 3.0.x, built against the same Boost above. (Can also use
    VR Juggler 2.2.x (2.2.2 or newer recommended), but 3.0 is much nicer.)

- OpenSceneGraph, including osgIntrospection/wrappers (2.8.x tested)

    - Recommended to use the branch here: <https://github.com/rpavlik/osg/tree/new-wrappers>
        which is available compiled for windows here: <https://github.com/rpavlik/osg-windows-binaries>

 - For GUI console support, highly recommended, at least one of the following:

    - Qt version 4.5 (?) or newer - best choice (don't use 4.6.2 on linux <https://bugreports.qt-project.org/browse/QTBUG-8537>) 
    - FLTK 1.1.10 (deprecated, and probably will be removed)

LuaBind, osgLua, and Lua 5.1 are included in the source tree and integrated
in to the build - you do not need to build these separately.

Building
--------
Just run CMake, being sure to set a build directory that is different
from your source directory. Tell it where to find any dependencies it
can't locate. You may wish to configure any of the build options,
including but not limited to `CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX` (where you want an
installed snapshot to be placed). Then, build the generated
project/makefiles in the binary directory.

If you have any issues running, particularly on Windows, try building
the "INSTALL" target and running it from the install location.

Windows Notes
-------------
Visual Studio 2008 may produce a number of "Incremental Linker has
stopped working" errors on clean builds. Usually, attempting the build
again (without cleaning) will succeed, but this is a pain. A hotfix is
available from Microsoft: <http://archive.msdn.microsoft.com/KB948127>
After installing the hotfix, do a clean re-build.
